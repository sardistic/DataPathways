<h1>Welcome to The Shire's Library: Elasticsearch and GPT-3 Guide</h1>

<h2>Overview: This is currently WIP and is non-functioning</h2>

<p>Welcome dear hobbit! In this corner of the Shire Library, you will find a guide on how to wield two powerful tools of Middle Earth - Elasticsearch and GPT-3. Elasticsearch is like the Shire's post office, capable of sorting and locating any piece of information at a moment's notice. On the other hand, GPT-3 is akin to Gandalf's spellbook, magically understanding and creating language.</p>

<p>By the time we see the bottom of this guide, you must have successfully embarked on and concluded your journey of integrating this structured data with GPT-3. A magnificent tool that works like fine Elven magic indeed!</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Pack your bag with good hearty Hobbit-sense and proceed with the following steps. Don't worry; no Trolls or Goblins are found along the way!</p>

<h3>1. Setting Up Elasticsearch</h3>

<p>Fear not, setting one up is easier than you'd imagine. In the city of men, simply use the following commandeering spell (in your command terminal, of course):</p>

<pre>
<code>
pip install elasticsearch
</code>
</pre>

<p>That's it! You've just set up your very own Elasticsearch, right here in the Shire.</p>

<h3>2. Summoning OpenAI's GPT-3.</h3>

<p>Next, simply run the spell below to invite the wise and powerful GPT-3 into your Python environment:</p>

<pre>
<code>
pip install openai
</code>
</pre>

<p>Congratulations, you're doing very well till now! Remember to keep the GPT-3 API key handy, it will be needed further down the road.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Now you are ready to dispatch your local Elasticsearch, sort and retrieve information, and dictate this data with simple, natural language in concert with GPT-3.</p>

<p>Settle down by the fire, and follow these instructions one by one:</p>

<h3>1. Note Down Your GPT-3 API Key</h3>

<p>Akin to the One Ring, the GPT-3 API key is a very precious artifact. Store it with care, and ensure you never lose it:</p>

<pre>
<code>
openai.api_key = 'YOUR_GPT_3_API_KEY'
</code>
</pre>

<h3>2. Ask GPT-3 a Question</h3>

<p>Next, pose your query to dear GPT-3:</p>

<pre>
<code>
question = "How long did I stay at Disneyland?" 
</code>
</pre>

<h3>3. Querying Elasticsearch</h3>

<p>With your question posed and answered, you can now communicate with Elasticsearch and fetch the right piece of information:</p>

<pre>
<code>
location_to_search = response['choices'][0]['text'].strip()
</code>
</pre>

<h3>4. Fetching and Returning Data</h3>

<p>Finally, put, fetch, and return the needed data:</p>

<pre>
<code>
create_index(es, index_name)
for data in load_json_files(directory):
    index_data(es, index_name, data)
    return follow_up_response['choices'][0]['text'].strip()
</code>
</pre>

<p>And there you are! You've successfully set everything up and are now armed and ready to embark on your next adventure, equipped with your own Elasticsearch and GPT-3 integration. Happy journeying, dear Hobbit!</p>
